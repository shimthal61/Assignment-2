# Assignment-2

Remember that you need to produce your assignment using R Markdown and submit the knitted .html file.
I want to see your code, your output and appropriate narrative describing (and justifying) your decisions.

Q1 The data in the file assignment_2_dataset_1.csv are from an experiment with 96 participants. We
measured how quickly people could pronounce a word that was presented to them. Words were presented
either normally (Condition A) or were visually degraded (Condition B). This was a between participants
factor of visual quality with 2 levels. Conduct an ANOVA to determine and interpret the effect of visual
quality on response time.

Q2 The data in the file assignment_2_dataset_2.csv are the same as in assignment_2_dataset1.csv
except now we have a measure of caffeine consumption (in cups of coffee) for each individual. (a) Conduct
the appropriate ANOVA to determine and interpret the effect of visual quality on response time when taking
account of caffeine consumption. (b) Use the lm() function to build the equivalent linear model and interpret
the output (comparing it to the ANOVA output).

Q3 The data in the file assignment_2_dataset_3.csv are from a 2 x 2 repeated measures design. 148
participants responded to a target image that was either positive or negative in valence. The target was
preceded by a prime that was either also positive or negative in valence. We want to determine whether
people responded faster to positive images following a positive prime (relative to following a negative prime),
and faster to negative images following a negative prime (relative to following a positive prime). Perform
the appropriate repeated measures ANOVA on the data to determine whether this is the case.

Merit-level marks can be achieved by writing code following the Tidyverse style guide, adding narrative
explaining the packages and functions that you are using, and building visualisations using the geoms we
covered in class.

Marks at distinction level can be achieve by doing the above plus using packages and/or functions that we
have not covered in class.
